    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Grilled cheese sandwiches are a great lunch food to snack on! Read below to see how 
        you can make it!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sliced Bread</li>
        <li> Around 1/3 Tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>Any Cheese of your liking (American Cheese is recomended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread 1/2 tablespoon of butter on each side of both slices of bread</li>
        <li>Place a cast iton skillet or heavy non-stick pan over low to medium/low heat. If you're using a griddle
            it should be at least 275 degrees F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the buttered down side
        </li>
        <li>Stack the cheese on one of the pieces of bread, cover it with the other piece of taost and flip the sandwich over.

            enough time for the exterior to crisp and brown and for the cheese to fully merit.

        <li>Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and the cheese is melted</li>
        <li>Cut the sandwich in half on the diagonalto serve</li>
